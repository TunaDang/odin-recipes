  <h2>How to Make Lasagna</h2>
  <p>Homemade lasagna may have a few steps, but each step is easy – and I assure you it’s worth the time; the perfect
    Italian meal!</p>

  <p>The ingredients in this recipe are all things you know and it’s not difficult at all! All you’ll need for this easy
    lasagna recipe is one pan, one bowl, and a 9×13 baking dish!</p>

  <p>A quick overview of the layers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cheese Filling</strong> Mix the ricotta and cheeses (per recipe below) with an egg in a bowl, and set
      aside. No ricotta? No problem, <em>cottage cheese</em> works just fine in this recipe!</li>
    <li><strong>Meat Sauce</strong> Brown the onion, garlic, and meat in a pot on the stovetop. Add the pasta sauce and
      tomato paste & simmer a few minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Layer Together</strong> Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with noodles and bake until bubbling
    </li>
  </ul>
